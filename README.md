</div>

This macro is for user's who really wants to grind some <u>potions</u>. Although I can't guarantee you guys that this macro is 100% but most likely this will really work. This macro is only for **NONVIP**. If you're a NONVIP like me. And if you're a first timer. You should download [TinyTask](https://tinytask.net/) once downloaded I will provide the settings for it below of this info. Once downloaded, Download the [Macro Here](https://github.com/ItzKashiii/SOLS-RNG-Era7/tree/main/ERA7-Macro/NONVIP/V0.1) for those only NONVIP Players. I will also provide a image how to use it.

<h3>TinyTask Settings</h3>
1. Play Speed must be on `1x`
2. Turn on the **Continuous Playback**
3. Your Playback Hotkey should be `F8`
